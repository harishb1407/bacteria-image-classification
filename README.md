# Bacteria Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This repository contains the code for the project titled "Bacteria Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks". The dataset for this project has been obtained from [Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bacteria-classification-at-the-genus-level/data) The dataset contains labelled images of 4 distinct classes of bacteria. This project uses convolutional neural networks and also transfer learning (VGG16) to classify the bacteria images correctly with a highest accuracy of 98% obtained using VGG16 transfer learning.

The following CNNs were used for performing the classification:
- LeNet
- AlexNet
- ResNet
- VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
